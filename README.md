### A little about me...
I started software development in the 5th grade and got my first programming job at 14. 
I've been programming for 6 years at the time of writing. As an aspiring entreprenuer, I have my own company called [Doge Industries](https://dogeindustries.com)
which strives to *provide the world with accessible services and products.* One of my major goals with Doge Industries is to start an internet service provider that
focuses on affordability. I have an interest in embedded systems and am currently learning electronics. I ocassionally create
aerial videography as a hobby; you can find my work on my YouTube channel. I love to learn and come up with new ideas.

### What skills do I have?
I know a lot of stuff! I've worked on web, game, and low level projects.

- Rust
- HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, NodeJS
- Dioxus, React, discord.js
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Roblox Game Development w/ Lua
- AWS, Heroku, Digital Ocean, and deploying/upgrading systems with thousands of users.

### What have I worked on?
I don't have many public projects to share, however I've done a big range of stuff from operating systems to large scale websites.
