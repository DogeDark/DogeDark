### A Little About Me
My name is Miles. I started software development 8 years ago and have worked primarily in web and game development with a current shift towards embedded systems. 
I am an aviation enthusiast and love to take [aerial videography](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYHTnCVVwN8sWS_bwGMMytQ) and build/fly RC airplanes. I am currently preparing for college to earn a degree in computer engineering.


### What skills do I have?
I've worked on a variety of projects, and my skill set is always changing. Below is the list of what I'd consider myself good & up-to-date with.

- Rust, HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript
- PostgreSQL, Docker 
- Basic UI/UX Design

### What have I worked on?
Most recently I had an internship at Dioxus Labs and helped build the awesome Rust UI framework called Dioxus. 
I also have a few free-time projects with embedded systems, building a homebrew smartwatch (hardware, code, and all!). 
This includes releasing a Rust-based open-source driver for the FT6X06 touch screen controller.

In my earlier career, I also worked on a liveops system for a game studio, which involved writing backend APIs, managing a database, and building a dashboard for live control over game systems.

- [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus) - My favorite project that I had the chance to intern at!
- [Dioxus Logger](https://github.com/DogeDark/dioxus-logger) - My first open source project; now merged into Dioxus directly.
- [Dioxus SDK](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/sdk) - A cross-platform SDK for the Dioxus project.
- [ft6x06-rs](https://github.com/DogeDark/ft6x06-rs) - An a/sync Rust driver for the FT6x06 capacitive touch screen.
- [myCPU](https://github.com/DogeDark/myCPU) - An experiment to emulate a custom CPU.
- [Rust LS](https://github.com/DogeDark/rust-ls) - One of my first "finished" Rust projects.
