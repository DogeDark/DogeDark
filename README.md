### A Little About Me
My name is Miles. I started software development almost 8 years ago and have worked primarily in web & game development with a current shift towards embedded systems. 
I am an aviation enthusiast and love to take [aerial videography](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYHTnCVVwN8sWS_bwGMMytQ) and build/fly RC airplanes. I currently work at Dioxus Labs, helping to develop an awesome cross-platform Rust GUI framework.


### What skills do I have?
I've worked on a variety of projects and my skillset is always changing. Below is the list of what I'd consider myself good & up-to-date with.

- Rust, HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript
- PostgreSQL, Docker 
- UI/UX Design

### What have I worked on?
I don't have many public projects to share, however, I've done a wide range of stuff from operating systems to large-scale websites.
Most prominently I've started contributing to [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus) and its ecosystem.

- [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus) - This is the project I work on at my job!
- [Dioxus Logger](https://github.com/DogeDark/dioxus-logger) - My first open source project; now merged into Dioxus directly.
- [Dioxus SDK](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/sdk) - A cross-platform SDK for the Dioxus project.
- [myCPU](https://github.com/DogeDark/myCPU) - An experiment to emulate a custom CPU.
- [Rust LS](https://github.com/DogeDark/rust-ls) - One of my first "finished" Rust projects.
- [ft6x06-rs](https://github.com/DogeDark/ft6x06-rs) - An a/sync Rust driver for the FT6x06 capacitive touch screen.
